Richies Molecular Dynamics Simulation

1. Initialise Particles
	a) Initialise Particles on a FCC/Cubic lattice +/- small perturbation 
	b) Set last few balls so Total Momentum = 0
	c) Allow user to choose number of balls and lattice spacing

2. Calculate Forces
	a) Performance Enhancements
		# Pairwise Calculations (Fab = -Fba)
		# LJ Lookup Table
		# Long Range LJ Cutoff
	b) Boundary Conditions
		# No Boundary 
		# Elastic Walls (Energy Conservation Considerations)
		# PBC need to find closest instance of other particles

3. Move Balls
	a) Verlet Algorithm
	b) Print Updated Positions to File
	c) Change 'Temperature' of the system

4. Calculate Observables
	a) Heat Capacity
	b) Position Auto-Correlation
	c) Velocity Auto-Correlation

5. Record Data
	a) Write relevant data to a file

6. Draw Motion
	a) Read in file and Draw Particle Motion
